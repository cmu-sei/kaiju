    <H1><A name="FnHashAction"></A>CERT Function Hashing</H1>

    <P>CERT Function Hashing is a collection of tools that allow for creation of static hashes
    that may be used to identify functions within a program or test similarity between programs.
    These hashes may be used in malware analysis and identification, including identifying
    important features of a program to include in YARA signatures.</P>
    
    <P>The Function Hashing feature consists of:</P>
    
    <UL>
        <LI>A Function Hashing Analyzer</LI>
        <LI>An Exporter that exports hashing data to both YARA format and a custom hash format</LI>
        <LI>A GUI Plugin for interactive analysis of the function hashing data of a single program</LI>
        <LI>A GUI Plugin for visualizing the intersection of function hashing data between multiple programs</LI>
    </UL>

    
    <H2>Running the Analyzer</H2>
    
    <P align="center"><IMG border="1" src="images/analyzer_selection.png"></P>

    <P align="center">Ensure the CERT Function Hashing analyzer is selected in the auto-analyze window.</P>
    
    <P>The Function Hashing analyzer may be run as part of Ghidra's Auto-Analysis step, or on its own as a
    one-shot analyzer via the menu in the Ghidra CodeBrowser. Before running the Auto-Analysis, a couple of
    options may be configured as shown below.</P>
    
    <P align="center"><IMG border="1" src="images/fnhash_analyzer_desc.png"></P>

    <P align="center">The Description and Options for the CERT Function Hashing analyzer.</P>
    
    <UL>
        <LI>"Include Basic Blocks". Check this to include basic blocks in the hashing algorithm.</LI>
        <LI>"Logging Level". Select the level of logs and notifications to use. The default is "WARN",
        but it may be lowered to "ERROR" to report only the most serious notifications indicating some
        kind of error or bug, or raised to "INFO" to include lots of information and
        notifications about how the analysis works.</LI>
        <LI>"Minimum Instruction Count." This option tells the analyzer how many instructions to look
        for before hashing a function. Setting a higher value might avoid small functions and thunks
        that do not help identify more complex malware. The current implementation does not
        fully respect this number so be aware you still may get some small functions in the hashing
        results.</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>After running the analyzer, you may receive a pop-up notification alerting you that the
    analysis is complete, and giving a count of how many functions were hashed.
    (This notification is controlled by the "Logging Level" option as shown above.)</P>
    
    <P align="center"><IMG border="1" src="images/fnhash_popup.png"></P>

    <P align="center">An example notification you may receive once analysis is complete, depending
    on your Logging Level.</P>
    
    
    <H2>Using The GUI Viewer Plugin</H2>
    
    <P>You can access the graphical interface (GUI) hash viewer via the Ghidra CodeBrowser menu
    <B>Window > CERT Function Hash Viewer</B>. Initially, the window will look blank like
    the following.</P>
    
    <P align="center"><IMG border="1" src="images/fnhash_table_first_start.png"></P>

    <P align="center">The initial blank hash viewer. Once the analyzer is run, this
    viewer will refresh to display the hashing data. If the viewer does not auto-refresh
    for some reason, you can also manually click the refresh button, which is the green
    "recycle" looking icon at the top of viewer window.</P>

    <P>If preferred, instead of a modal window, you can click and hold, then drag and drop the
    window into your preferred location in the CodeBrowser to have it permanently visible.
    This might be useful if you intend to regularly use the Function Hashing capability.</P>

    <P>Once analyzer data is available, the viewer will look like the following:</P>
    
    <P align="center"><IMG border="1" src="images/fnhash_table_refreshed.png"></P>

    <P align="center">The viewer displaying hashing data.</P>
    
    <P>The columns can be customized to display different types of hashes by right-clicking
    on the table's title bar and selecting the "Add/Remove Columns" option from the pop-up
    menu. The CERT Function Hashing analyzer currently creates the following types of hashes:</P>
    
    <UL>
        <LI>"Exact Hash". The MD5 hash of the exact bytes that make up the function.</LI>
        <LI>"PIC Hash". The MD5 of the "position-independent" bytes. This algorithm attempts to
        identify which bytes represent addresses, and replace addresses with "00" bytes to
        create a position-independent hash that is equivalent across implementations.</LI>
        <LI>"Mnemonic Hash". The MD5 of the string representing the instruction mnemonics
        and counts of how many of those instructions occur in the function bytes.
        This is an experimental hash, and not visible by default.</LI>
        <LI>"Mnemonic Category Hash". The MD5 of the string that represents the categories
        of instruction mnemonics appearing in the function bytes. The categories include
        arithmetic instructions, memory instructions (store, load, etc.), and more.
        This is an experimental hash, and not visible by default.</LI>
    </UL>
    
    
    <H2>Exporting Hashing Data</H2>
    
    <P>The hashing data may be saved to an external file for use with other tools.
    Currently, we support two different types of exports:</P>
    
    <UL>
        <LI>"Export to CSV", which exports the hashing data to a comma-separated values (CSV)
        list.</LI>
        <LI>"Export to YARA", which exports only the hashing data relevant to identifying
        the function to the YARA format that may then be imported into other malware analysis
        and defense tools.</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>If one or more rows in the viewer table are selected by the user, the export buttons
    will export <B>only</B> the selected rows. This allows an analyst to generate YARA
    signatures for only the chosen interesting functions, for example. If no rows are selected,
    the buttons will then export hashing data for all functions in the table.</P>
    
    <H2>Using The Function Hash Intersection Visualization Plugin</H2>
    
    <P>You can access the graphical interface (GUI) intersection visualization via the Ghidra
    CodeBrowser menu <B>Window > CERT Function Intersection Visualizer</B>.</P>
    
    <P align="center"><IMG border="1" src="images/fnhash_fse.png"></P>

    <P align="center">An example of using the Hash Intersection Visualization Plugin.
    Each program is represented by a column on the left side of the screen, in which
    the cell is marked with an 'X' if the program contains that function PIC hash
    represented in each row.</P>

    <P>As with the Hash Viewer plugin, this window may be docked with Ghidra if you expect
    to use it regularly.</P>
